# Compatibility ABIs for LSP6

This folder contains historical ABIs from previous release versions.

- `v0.14.0`: LSP6 interface ID was `0x23f34c62`.
- `v0.13.0`: LSP6 interface ID was `0x23f34c62`.
- `v0.12.0`: LSP6 interface ID was `0x23f34c62`.

This is to enable dApps and projects to be backward compatible in their interfaces to display and interact with LSP6 token contracts deployed with these old versions, by consuming their old ABIs.
