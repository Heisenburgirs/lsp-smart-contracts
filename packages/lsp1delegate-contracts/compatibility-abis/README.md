# Compatibility ABIs for LSP1

This folder contains historical ABIs from previous release versions.

- `v0.14.0`: LSP1 interface ID was `0xa245bbda`.
- `v0.13.0`: LSP1 interface ID was `0xa245bbda`.
- `v0.12.0`: LSP1 interface ID was `0xa245bbda`.

This is to enable dApps and projects to be backward compatible in their interfaces to display and interact with LSP1 token contracts deployed with these old versions, by consuming their old ABIs.
