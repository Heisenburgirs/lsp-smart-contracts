# Compatibility ABIs for LSP7

This folder contains historical ABIs from previous release versions.

- `v0.14.0`: LSP7 interface ID was `0xb3c4928f`.
- `v0.13.0`: LSP7 interface ID was `0xb3c4928f`.
- `v0.12.0`: LSP7 interface ID was `0xdaa746b7`.

This is to enable dApps and projects to be backward compatible in their interfaces to display and interact with LSP7 token contracts deployed with these old versions, by consuming their old ABIs.
