# Compatibility ABIs for UnviersalProfile

This folder contains historical ABIs from previous release versions.

- `v0.14.0`: UnviersalProfile interface ID was `0x1a0eb6a5`.
- `v0.13.0`: UnviersalProfile interface ID was `0x1a0eb6a5`.
- `v0.12.0`: UnviersalProfile interface ID was `0x1a0eb6a5`.

This is to enable dApps and projects to be backward compatible in their interfaces to display and interact with UnviersalProfile token contracts deployed with these old versions, by consuming their old ABIs.
