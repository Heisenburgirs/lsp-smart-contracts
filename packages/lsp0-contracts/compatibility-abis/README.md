# Compatibility ABIs for LSP0

This folder contains historical ABIs from previous release versions.

- `v0.14.0`: LSP0 interface ID was `0x24871b3d`.
- `v0.13.0`: LSP0 interface ID was `0x24871b3d`.
- `v0.12.0`: LSP0 interface ID was `0x24871b3d`.

This is to enable dApps and projects to be backward compatible in their interfaces to display and interact with LSP0 token contracts deployed with these old versions, by consuming their old ABIs.
