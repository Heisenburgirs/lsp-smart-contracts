# Compatibility ABIs for LS8

This folder contains historical ABIs from previous release versions.

- `v0.14.0`: LSP8 interface ID was `0x3a271706`.
- `v0.13.0`: LSP8 interface ID was `0xecad9f75`.
- `v0.12.0`: LSP8 interface ID was `0x30dc5278`.

This is to enable dApps and projects to be backward compatible in their interfaces to display and interact with LSP8 token contracts deployed with these old versions, by consuming their old ABIs.
